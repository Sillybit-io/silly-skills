## Prompt

> Add a release-notes skill to this repository. It should turn merged pull requests into a human-focused changelog and recommend the SemVer bump that goes with it.

This is the real Roadmap entry at `README.md:83` in this repository, used as-is as a real feature request.

## Without skill

An agent with no plan-writer still produces a reasonable-looking task list, but it is a to-do list, not a plan: no exploration is shown, no category decision is made explicit, and the acceptance criteria are not things another agent could check.

```markdown
Plan for the release-notes skill:

1. Create `skills/workflow/release-notes/SKILL.md` with the usual sections.
2. Write `examples.md` next to it.
3. Update the README to list the new skill and bump the badge.
4. Add a CHANGELOG entry.
5. Run `bun run validate` to make sure it passes.

I'll have the skill read merged PRs (probably with `gh pr list --state merged`) and
turn them into a changelog section, then suggest whether the release should be a
patch, minor, or major bump based on the PR titles.
```

This baseline never opens `skill-writer/SKILL.md` to check the six-section contract, never notices that `scripts/validate.ts` enforces the README's skill-count badge as an exact match, and its one acceptance criterion — "make sure it passes" — is not something a second agent could run without guessing which command and which exit code count as success. It also picks the `workflow` category without saying why, and it never asks whether the skill should write the changelog entry into `CHANGELOG.md` directly or only print it, even though that choice affects a file the repository's own release tooling parses.

## With skill

**Step 1 — restate and classify.** "Add a release-notes skill that turns merged pull requests into a changelog and a SemVer recommendation." Intent: `build`. Tier: `standard` — four files touched (`SKILL.md`, `examples.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`), one real design decision (how the skill sources merged pull requests and what it does with the changelog entry), no migration, no public interface change outside this repository. `review: optional`.

**Step 2 — resume check.** No `docs/plans/*release-notes*` file exists yet. Start fresh.

**Step 3 — idea refinement.** The request already names a concrete deliverable (a skill that turns merged pull requests into a changelog and a bump recommendation), so it passes the idea-vagueness test. Skipped; noted in one line and moved on.

**Step 4 — branch name.** `CONTRIBUTING.md` states no branch convention. Sampling this repository's own recent branches (`git branch -a`) shows two real patterns: `feat/<slug>` and `<username>/<ticket-id>-<slug>`. This request has no tracked ticket, so the `<username>/...` pattern does not apply; the observed `feat/<slug>` pattern does. Branch: `feat/add-release-notes-skill`.

**Step 5 — explore.** Reads, in order: `README.md` (the roadmap line at `:83`, the Skills table, the badge line), `skills/workflow/skill-writer/SKILL.md` (the category list at `:35`, the six-section contract), `scripts/validate.ts` (`CATEGORIES` at `:83-89`, `checkBadgeCount` at `:463`), `CHANGELOG.md` (the `## [Unreleased]` heading at `:7`), and `skills/workflow/issue-refiner/SKILL.md` for the shape of a "preference order" table, since release-notes will need one for how it sources pull requests. 12 files read, under budget.

**Step 6 — ticket vagueness.** Not applicable; this came as a direct request, not a tracked ticket.

**Step 7 — research.** Queries come from the request: a human-focused changelog generated from merged pull requests, plus a SemVer recommendation. Two pages opened, under the budget of 5 searches and 5 pages. [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) groups entries as Added, Changed, and Fixed and tells the writer to record changes for people, not as a commit dump. [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) maps a breaking change to major, a backward-compatible feature to minor, and a fix to patch. What this plan will follow: print a Keep a Changelog block and a SemVer recommendation, and do not invent a second grouping scheme. Queries not run: none.

**Step 8 — IS/GAP ledger, risks, and the slop check.**

| Gap | IS today (evidence) | GAP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | `README.md:83` lists `release-notes` as a Roadmap bullet with no implementation | No `skills/*/release-notes/SKILL.md` exists |
| G2 | `skill-writer/SKILL.md:35` requires one of six categories and the fixed six-section body | The new skill must pick a category and follow the contract exactly |
| G3 | `scripts/validate.ts:463` (`checkBadgeCount`) fails the build unless the README badge equals the discovered skill count | Adding a skill without updating the badge and the Roadmap line breaks `bun run validate` |
| G4 | `CHANGELOG.md:7` (`## [Unreleased]`) has no entry for this skill | A new skill needs a `### Added` line in the same change, per `CONTRIBUTING.md` |

Hidden requirements and risks, still in step 8:

| Risk | What breaks | Mitigation | Carried by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Description over 700 characters | Costs tokens in every session's system prompt, against the house rule this repository now follows | Keep the description under 700 characters and verify with a length check | T1 |
| Badge count drifts from the real skill count | `bun run validate` fails with `BADGE_COUNT` | Bump the badge in the same commit that adds the skill | T3 |

The category defaults to `workflow` during the slop check — it produces a repository artifact from git history the way `conventions-codifier` does, not a review of a diff the way the `review` skills do. The slop check cuts one item a first draft might add: a new `bun run release-notes` package script — the request never asked for a script, only a skill.

**Step 9 — product questions, then technical.** Product is already settled by the request: the person cutting the release, success is a changelog block plus a bump recommendation, and a package script is out of scope. One technical question is still open: **"Should release-notes write its entry directly into `CHANGELOG.md`, or only print it for the user to paste?"** Writing directly touches a file `scripts/prepare-release.ts` also parses, so a wrong default could corrupt a release. Default if unanswered: print only.

**Step 10 — draft file and gate.** Because one technical question is open, plan-writer writes the draft — TL;DR, Scope, Research, and Questions — and stops.

```markdown
Plan drafted: `docs/plans/2026-09-26-add-release-notes-skill.md` — tier standard.
- Effort: M — four files, one design decision, no migration
- Risk: low — additive change, existing skills and validator checks are unaffected
- Decisions made: category is `workflow` because the skill produces a repository artifact from git history, not a diff review
- Owner decisions pending: should release-notes write into `CHANGELOG.md` directly, or only print the entry? Writing directly touches a file `scripts/prepare-release.ts` also parses. Default if unanswered: print only.
- Cut from scope: a `bun run release-notes` package script — not requested

Owner decisions needed before this plan can be filled in:
1. Write into `CHANGELOG.md` directly, or print the entry only? — only the owner can accept the risk of an automated edit to a file the release tooling parses. Default if unanswered: print only.
```

The open question in the reply is the technical one. The product decisions are already settled, so the draft records them under `### Product` and the reply does not ask them again.

**After the answer ("print only, for now").** plan-writer resumes at step 11. The answer confirms the recorded default and introduces no new technology or constraint, so the second research pass does not run. `ui: no` — this is a Bun CLI repository with no web or mobile surface, and this plan does not add one, so the final verification wave has no UI QA todo. The request is a list of files to add, not a process or a user journey, so `## Design` records the omission.

# Add a release-notes skill

## TL;DR

- Effort: M — four files, one design decision, no migration
- Risk: low — additive change, existing skills and validator checks are unaffected
- Decisions made: category is `workflow` because the skill produces a repository artifact from git history, not a diff review; pull-request source order follows `issue-refiner`'s preference-table pattern (`gh` first, `glab` second, `git log <tag>..HEAD` as a fallback)
- Owner decisions pending: none — write into `CHANGELOG.md` directly, or print only? Answered: print only
- Cut from scope: a `bun run release-notes` package script — not requested
- Branch: `feat/add-release-notes-skill` — follows this repository's own observed `feat/<slug>` pattern; no tracked ticket, so the `<username>/<ticket-id>-<slug>` pattern seen elsewhere does not apply

## Scope

### Affected users

Maintainers cutting a release, who currently write the changelog and pick the SemVer bump by hand.

### Ideal state

Running the skill against a range of merged pull requests produces a ready-to-paste `### Added` / `### Changed` / `### Fixed` block and a recommended bump, without touching `CHANGELOG.md` itself.

### IS / GAP ledger

| Gap | IS today (evidence) | GAP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | `README.md:83` lists `release-notes` as a Roadmap bullet with no implementation | No `skills/workflow/release-notes/SKILL.md` exists |
| G2 | `skill-writer/SKILL.md:35` requires one of six categories and the fixed six-section body | The new skill must follow the contract exactly |
| G3 | `scripts/validate.ts:463` fails the build unless the README badge equals the discovered skill count | The badge and the Roadmap line need updating in the same change |
| G4 | `CHANGELOG.md:7` has no entry for this skill | A `### Added` line is required in the same change |

### Risks

| Risk | What breaks | Mitigation | Carried by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Description over 700 characters | Costs tokens in every session's system prompt | Keep the description under 700 characters and check its length | T1 |
| Badge count drifts from the real skill count | `bun run validate` fails with `BADGE_COUNT` | Bump the badge in the same commit that adds the skill | T3 |

### Must have

- A `skills/workflow/release-notes/SKILL.md` and `examples.md` that pass `bun run validate` (G1, G2)
- The README table, badge, and Roadmap updated in the same change (G3)
- A `CHANGELOG.md` entry in the same change (G4)

### Must NOT have

- A new `bun run release-notes` package script — not requested
- Any write to `CHANGELOG.md` from the skill itself — the owner chose print-only

## Research

- Sources: [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)
- How others did it: Keep a Changelog groups a release into Added, Changed, and Fixed, written for people. SemVer picks major, minor, or patch from whether the change breaks callers, adds a compatible feature, or only fixes.
- What matters: one grouping scheme, and a bump rule that follows the change rather than the pull request count.
- Pros and cons: printing the entry keeps the release tooling's parse of `CHANGELOG.md` intact; writing the file directly is faster and can corrupt that parse.
- What this plan will follow: print a Keep a Changelog block and a SemVer recommendation.
- Queries not run: none

## Questions

### Product

- Who it is for — answer: the person cutting the release. The request already names a human-focused changelog.
- What success looks like — answer: a ready-to-paste changelog block and a recommended bump.
- Out of scope — answer: a package script. The request asked for a skill, not a script.

### Technical

- Write the entry into `CHANGELOG.md`, or print it only? — answer: print only. Writing the file touches a file `scripts/prepare-release.ts` also parses.

## Design

Diagram: omitted — the request is a list of files to add, not a process, a user journey, or a system interaction.

## Verification strategy

| Gap | Proof | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | `bun run validate` | reports one more skill than before, 0 errors |
| G2 | manual read of `SKILL.md` | exactly six H2 sections in the fixed order, footer present |
| G3 | `bun run validate` | no `BADGE_COUNT` error |
| G4 | `grep -c 'release-notes' CHANGELOG.md` | at least 1 |

## Execution strategy

- T0: copy this plan into the project if it is not already there
- Wave 1: T1, T2 (independent)
- Wave 2: T3 (needs T1, to know the final skill name and description)
- Wave 3: T4 (needs T3, to reference the final line numbers)
- Final wave: F1, F2, F3, F4

## Todos

Every todo starts with `- [ ] Open`. When you build this plan, change that line to `- [x] Done` in the project copy as soon as the todo is finished, before you start the next one. If T0 copied the file, keep editing that copy.

### T0 — Copy the plan into the project

- [ ] Open
- Do: if this file is not already inside the project, copy it to `docs/plans/` under its current name and do the rest of the build there. If it is already there, do not copy it.
- Must not: change any other part of the plan while copying, or make a second copy when it is already in the project
- Closes gap: none
- Depends on: none
- References: this file
- Acceptance: the file exists at `docs/plans/2026-09-26-add-release-notes-skill.md` inside the project
- QA scenario: happy — the file is already under `docs/plans/` and this box is checked with no second copy; failure — the file is outside the project, one copy appears under `docs/plans/`, and the outside file is left as it was
- Commit: no

### T1 — Write the release-notes SKILL.md

- [ ] Open
- Do: write `skills/workflow/release-notes/SKILL.md` following `skill-writer`'s six-section contract; source pull requests with the preference order `gh pr list --state merged` first, `glab mr list --merged` second, `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline` as a fallback; keep the description under 700 characters
- Must not: write into `CHANGELOG.md`; the skill only prints the entry
- Closes gap: G1, G2
- Depends on: none
- References: `skills/workflow/skill-writer/SKILL.md:35`, `skills/workflow/issue-refiner/SKILL.md` (preference-table pattern)
- Acceptance: `bun run validate` reports no `LAYOUT`, `FRONTMATTER`, `NAME_MISMATCH`, or `FOOTER` error for this file
- QA scenario: happy — run the skill against this repository's own last five merged pull requests, expect a changelog block and a bump recommendation; failure — run it with no merged pull requests in range, expect it to say so and print nothing
- Commit: no, folds into the wave commit

### T2 — Write examples.md

- [ ] Open
- Do: write `skills/workflow/release-notes/examples.md` with a real scenario built from this repository's own merged pull requests
- Must not: invent pull request titles that were not actually merged
- Closes gap: G1
- Depends on: T1
- References: `skills/workflow/skill-writer/SKILL.md` (`### examples.md` rules)
- Acceptance: `bun run validate` reports no `MISSING_EXAMPLES` error for `skills/workflow/release-notes/`
- QA scenario: happy — the three required headings appear in order; failure — a temporary blank `examples.md` reproduces `MISSING_EXAMPLES`, then is restored
- Commit: no, folds into the wave commit

### T3 — Update the README

- [ ] Open
- Do: bump the skill-count badge by one, add a `workflow | release-notes` row to the Skills table, remove the Roadmap bullet at `README.md:83`
- Must not: touch any other Roadmap entry
- Closes gap: G3
- Depends on: T1
- References: `README.md:83`, `scripts/validate.ts:463`
- Acceptance: `bun run validate` reports no `BADGE_COUNT` error
- QA scenario: happy — the badge, the table row, and the Roadmap removal are all present; failure — leaving the badge unbumped reproduces `BADGE_COUNT`, then is fixed
- Commit: no, folds into the wave commit

### T4 — Add the CHANGELOG entry

- [ ] Open
- Do: add one `### Added` line under `## [Unreleased]` naming the new skill in the same one-line style as the existing 0.1.0 entries
- Must not: create a new release section; this stays under `[Unreleased]`
- Closes gap: G4
- Depends on: T3
- References: `CHANGELOG.md:7`
- Acceptance: `grep -c 'release-notes' CHANGELOG.md` is at least 1
- QA scenario: happy — the line appears under `### Added`; failure — n/a, this is a documentation-only edit
- Commit: yes — `feat(workflow): add release-notes skill`

## Final verification wave

The same checkbox rule applies here. Change `- [ ] Open` to `- [x] Done` in the project copy when that gate is finished, before the next one starts.

### F1 — Plan compliance

- [ ] Open
- Do: confirm the skill file, `examples.md`, the README row, and the changelog line exist, and that no `bun run release-notes` script was added
- Acceptance: `bun run validate` reports the new skill and no `BADGE_COUNT` error, and `package.json` has no `release-notes` script
- Commit: no

### F2 — Code quality

- [ ] Open
- Do: run `bun run validate` and `bun test`. This repository defines no separate build command. Then scan the new skill for an empty code block left as a placeholder and for a description over 700 characters.
- Acceptance: both commands exit 0, and the description is under 700 characters
- Commit: no

### F3 — Scenario QA

- [ ] Open
- Do: execute the happy and failure QA scenario on T1, T2, T3, and T4
- Acceptance: the changelog block and bump recommendation print, an empty pull-request range prints nothing, and a missing `examples.md` reproduces `MISSING_EXAMPLES` before it is restored
- Commit: no

### F4 — Scope fidelity

- [ ] Open
- Do: compare the diff with T1 through T4
- Acceptance: the diff touches only `skills/workflow/release-notes/`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`
- Commit: no

`ui: no` — this repository is a Bun CLI and a markdown catalogue with no web or mobile surface, and this plan adds none, so no automated UI QA todo is added.

## Success criteria

| Gap | Closed by | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | T1, T2 | `bun run validate` reports the new skill, 0 errors |
| G2 | T1 | manual read confirms the six-section contract |
| G3 | T3 | `bun run validate` reports no `BADGE_COUNT` error |
| G4 | T4 | `CHANGELOG.md` names the skill under `[Unreleased]` |

### When idea refinement actually fires

The prompt above already names a concrete deliverable, so step 3 skips straight past idea refinement. A fuzzier version of the same request shows the other branch: "We should make it easier for maintainers to see what changed before they cut a release." This states a problem area, not a change, and neither who benefits precisely nor what "easier" means can be inferred from the request alone — it fails the idea-vagueness test.

```markdown
Before I explore the codebase, three quick questions:
1. Who hits this most — the person cutting the release, or reviewers checking what shipped?
2. What would "easier" look like when it's done: a generated changelog draft, a dashboard, something else?
3. Any constraint I should design around — must it avoid touching CHANGELOG.md directly, must it need no new dependency, anything else out of scope?
```

Answering "the person cutting the release; a generated changelog draft; must not write CHANGELOG.md directly" turns the fuzzy idea into exactly the request used above, and step 1 restates and classifies it from there. In a non-interactive run, or if the user has nothing to add, plan-writer proceeds on its own best reading and records the assumption under "Decisions made" instead of stopping.
